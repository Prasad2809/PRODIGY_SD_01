Prodigy InfoTech Software Development Internship TASK-1

# Prodigy InfoTech Internship: Software Development
Welcome to the Prodigy InfoTech Internship repository! These repository documents are for Task 1 of my internship journey, which focuses on creating innovative, simple, flexible programs.

# Task Overview
Create a program that converts temperature between Celsius Fahrenheit and Kelvin scales. The program should encourage the user to input a temperature value and the original unit of measurement. It should then convert that temperature to the other two units and display the converted values to the user.

# Knowledge Gained
Task 1 improved my ability to create logic for converting Temperatures in various units such as Kelvin, Fahrenheit, and Celsius. Also, I'm able to develop a program of such conversions precisely.
